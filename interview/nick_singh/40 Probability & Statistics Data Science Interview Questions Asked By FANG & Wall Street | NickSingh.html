Although it is not necessary to know all of the ins-and-outs of combinatorics, it is helpful to understand the basics for simplifying problems. One classic example here is the “stars and bars” counting method.</p><p>The other core topic to study is random variables. Knowing concepts related to expectation, variance, covariance, along with the basic probability distributions is crucial.</p><h3>Probability Distributions</h3><p>For modeling random variables, knowing the basics of various probability distributions is essential. Understanding both discrete and continuous examples, combined with expectations and variances, is crucial. The most common distributions discussed in interviews are the Uniform and Normal but there are plenty of other well-known distributions for particular use cases (Poisson, Binomial, Geometric).</p><p>Most of the time knowing the basics and their applications should suffice. For example, which distribution would flipping a coin be under? What about waiting for an event? It never hurts being able to do the derivations for expectation, variance, or other higher moments.</p><h3>Hypothesis Testing</h3><p>Hypothesis testing is the backbone behind statistical inference and can be broken down into a couple of topics. The first is the Central Limit Theorem, which plays an important role in studying large samples of data. Other core elements of hypothesis testing: sampling distributions, p-values, confidence intervals, type I and II errors. Lastly, it is worth looking at various tests involving proportions, and other hypothesis tests.</p><p>Most of these concepts play a crucial role in A/B testing, which is a commonly asked topic during interviews at consumer-tech companies like Facebook, Amazon, and Uber. It&#x27;s useful to not only understand the technical details but also conceptually how A/B testing operates, what the assumptions are, possible pitfalls, and applications to real-life products.</p><h3>Modeling</h3><p>Modeling relies on a strong understanding of probability distributions and hypothesis testing. Since it is a broad term, we will refer to modeling as the areas which have a strong statistical intersection with Machine Learning. This includes topics such as: linear regression, maximum likelihood estimation, &amp; bayesian statistics. For interviews focused on modeling and machine learning, knowing these topics is essential.</p><h2>20 Probability Interview Problems Asked By Top-Tech Companies &amp; Wall Street</h2><ol role="list"><li><strong>[Facebook - Easy]</strong> There is a fair coin (one side heads, one side tails) and an unfair coin (both sides tails).

Let U denote the case where we are flipping the unfair coin and F denote the case where we are flipping a fair coin. Since the coin is chosen randomly, we know that P(U) = P(F) = 0.5. Let 5T denote the event where we flip 5 heads in a row. Then we are interested in solving for P(U|5T), i.e., the probability that we are flipping the unfair coin, given that we saw 5 tails in a row.</p><p>We know P(5T|U) = 1 since by definition the unfair coin will always result in tails. Additionally, we know that P(5T|F) = 1/2^5 = 1/32 by definition of a fair coin. By Bayes Theorem we have:</p><p>\[P(U|5T) = \frac{P(5T|U) * P(U)}{P(5T|U) * P(U) + P(5T|F) * P(F)} = \frac{0.5}{0.5 + 0.5 * 1/32} = 0.97\]</p><p>Therefore the probability we picked the unfair coin is about 97%.</p><p><strong>Problem #5 Solution:</strong></p><p>By definition, a chord is a line segment whereby the two endpoints lie on the circle. Therefore, two arbitrary chords can always be represented by any four points chosen on the circle. If you choose to represent the first chord by two of the four points then you have:</p><p>\[{4\choose2} = 6 \]</p><p>choices of choosing the two points to represent chord 1 (and hence the other two will represent chord 2). However, note that in this counting, we are duplicating the count of each chord twice since a chord with endpoints p1 and p2 is the same as a chord with endpoints p2 and p1. Therefore the proper number of valid chords is:</p><p>\[\frac{1}{2}{4\choose2} = 3\]</p><p>Among these three configurations, only exactly one of the chords will intersect, hence the desired probability is:</p><p>\[p = \frac{1}{3}\]</p><p><strong>Problem #13 Solution:</strong></p><p>Let X be the number of coin flips needed until two heads. Then we want to solve for E[X]. Let H denote a flip that resulted in heads, and T denote a flip that resulted in tails. Note that E[X] can be written in terms of E[X|H] and E[X|T], i.e. the expected number of flips needed, conditioned on a flip being either heads or tails respectively.</p><p>Conditioning on the first flip, we have:</p><p>\[E[X] = \frac{1}{2}(1+E[X|H]) + \frac{1}{2}(1+E[X|T])\]</p><p>Note that E[X|T] = E[X] since if a tail is flipped, we need to start over in getting two heads in a row.</p><p>To solve for E[X|H], we can condition it further on the next outcome: either heads (HH) or tails (HT).</p><p>Therefore, we have:</p><p>\[E[X|H] = \frac{1}{2}(1+E[X|HH]) + \frac{1}{2}(1+E[X|HT])\]</p><p>Note that if the result is HH, then E[X|HH] = 0 since the outcome was achieved, and that E[X|HT] = E[X] since a tail was flipped, we need to start over again, so:</p><p>\[E[X|H] = \frac{1}{2}(1+0) + \frac{1}{2}(1+E[X]) = 1 + \frac{1}{2}E[X]\]</p><p>Plugging this into the original equation yields E[X] = 6 coin flips</p><p><strong>Problem #15 Solution:</strong></p><p>Consider the first n coins that A flips, versus the n coins that B flips.</p><p>There are three possible scenarios:</p><ol role="list"><li>A has more heads than B</li><li>A and B have an equal amount of heads</li><li>A has less heads than B</li></ol><p>Notice that in scenario 1, A will always win (irrespective of coin n+1), and in scenario 3, A will always lose (irrespective of coin n+1). By symmetry, these two scenarios have an equal probability of occurring.</p><p>Denote the probability of either scenario as x, and the probability of scenario 2 as y.</p><p>We know that 2x + y = 1 since these 3 scenarios are the only possible outcomes. Now let’s consider coin n+1. If the flip results in heads, with probability 0.5, then A will have won after scenario 2 (which happens with probability y). Therefore, A’s total chances of winning the game are increased by 0.5y.</p><p>Thus, the probability that A will win the game is:</p><p>\[x + \frac{1}{2}y = x + \frac{1}{2}(1-2x) = \frac{1}{2}\]</p><p><strong>Problem #18 Solution:</strong></p><p>Let B be the event that all n rolls have a value less than or equal to r. Then we have:</p><p>\[P(B_r) = \frac{r^n}{6^n}\]</p><p>since all n rolls must have a value less than or equal to r. Let A be the event that the largest number is r. We have:</p><p>\[B_r = B_{r-1} \cup A_r\]</p><p>and since the two events on the right hand side are disjoint, we have:</p><p>\[P(B_r) = P(B_{r-1}) + P(A_r)\]</p><p>Therefore, the probability of A is given by:</p><p>\[P(A_r) = P(B_{r}) - P(B_{r-1}) = \frac{r^n}{6^n} - \frac{(r-1)^n}{6^n}\]</p><h2>Solutions To Statistics Interview Questions </h2><p><strong>Problem #2 Solution:</strong></p><p>There will be two main problems. The first is that the coefficient estimates and signs will vary dramatically, depending on what particular variables you include in the model. In particular, certain coefficients may even have confidence intervals that include 0 (meaning it is difficult to tell whether an increase in that X value is associated with an increase or decrease in Y). The second is that the resulting p-values will be misleading - an important variable might have a high p-value and deemed insignificant even though it is actually important.</p><p>You can deal with this problem by either removing or combining the correlated predictors. In removing the predictors, it is best to understand the causes of the correlation (i.e. did you include extraneous predictors or such as both X and 2X). For combining predictors, it is possible to include interaction terms (the product of the two). Lastly, you should also 1) center data, and 2) try to obtain a larger sample size (which will lead to narrower confidence intervals).</p><p><strong>Problem #9 Solution:</strong></p><p>For X ~U(a, b) we have the following:</p><p>\[f_X(x) = \frac{1}{b-a}\]</p><p>Therefore we can calculate the mean as:</p><p>\[E[X] = \int_{a}^{b}xf_X(x)dx = \int_{a}^{b}\frac{x}{b-a}dx = \frac{x^2}{2(b-a)} \Big|_a^b = \frac{a+b}{2}\]</p><p>Similarly for variance we want:</p><p>\[Var(X) = E[X^2] - E[X]^2\]</p><p>And we have:</p><p>\[E[X^2] = \int_{a}^{b}x^2f_X(x)dx = \int_{a}^{b}\frac{x^2}{b-a}dx = \frac{x^3}{3(b-a)} \Big|_a^b = \frac{a^2+ab+b^2}{3}\]</p><p>Therefore:</p><p>\[Var(X) = \frac{a^2+ab+b^2}{3} - (\frac{a+b}{2})^2 = \frac{(b-a)^2}{12}\]</p><p><strong>Problem #12 Solution:</strong></p><p>Since X is normally distributed, we can look at the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the normal distribution:</p><p>\[\Phi(x) = P(X \le x) \]</p><p>To check the probability X is at least 2, we can check (knowing that X is distributed as standard normal):</p><p>\[\Phi(2) = P(X \le 2) = P(X \le \mu + 2\sigma) = 0.977 \]</p><p>Therefore P(X &gt; 2) = 1 - 0.977 = 0.023 for any given day. Since the draws are independent each day, then the expected time until drawing an X &gt; 2 follows a geometric distribution, with p = 0.023. Let T be a random variable denoting the number of days, then we have:</p><p>\[E[T] = \frac{1}{p} = \frac{1}{.024} \approx 43 \space \text{days}\]</p><p><strong>Problem #14 Solution:</strong></p><p>Because the sample size of flips is large (1000), we can apply the Central Limit Theorem. Since each individual flip is a Bernoulli random variable, we can assume it has a probability of showing up heads as p. Then we want to test whether p is 0.5 (i.e. whether it is fair). The Central Limit Theorem allows us to approximate the total number of heads seen as being normally distributed.</p><p>More specifically, the number of heads seen should follow a Binomial distribution since it a sum of Bernoulli random variables. If the coin is not biased (p = 0.5), then we have the following on the expected number of heads:</p><p>\[\mu = np = 1000*0.5 = 500\]</p><p>and the variance is given by:</p><p>\[\sigma^2 = np(1-p) = 1000*0.5*0.5 = 250, \sigma = \sqrt{250} \approx 16\]</p><p>Since this mean and standard deviation specify the normal distribution, we can calculate the corresponding z-score for 550 heads:</p><p>\[z = \frac{550-500}{16} &gt; 3\]</p><p>This means that, if the coin were fair, the event of seeing 550 heads should occur with a &lt; 1% chance under normality assumptions. Therefore, the coin is likely biased.</p><p><strong>Problem #20 Solution:</strong></p><p>Assume we have n Bernoulli trials each with a success probability of p:</p><p>\[x_1, x_2, ... x_n, \space x_i \sim Ber(p)\]</p><p>Assuming iid trials, we can compute the sample mean for p from a large number of trials:</p><p>\[\hat{\mu} = \frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^{n}x_i\]</p><p>We know the expectation of this sample mean is:</p><p>\[E[\hat{\mu}] = \frac{np}{n} = p\]</p><p>Additionally, we can compute the variance of this sample mean:</p><p>\[Var(\hat{\mu}) = \frac{np(1-p)}{n^2} = \frac{p(1-p)}{n}\]</p><p>Assume we sample a large n. Due to the Central Limit Theorem, our sample mean will be normally distributed:</p><p>\[\hat{\mu} \sim N(p, \frac{p(1-p)}{n})\]</p><p>Therefore we can take a z-score of our sampled mean as:</p><p>\[z(\hat{\mu}) = \frac{\hat{\mu} - p}{\sqrt{\frac{p(1-p)}{n}}}\]</p><p>This z-score will then be a simulated value from a standard normal distribution.</p><h2>Stay-in-the-loop: How To Get More Data Science Interview Prep Resources</h2><p>Make sure you follow along the <a href="https://www.instagram.com/acedatascienceinterviews/">Acing The Data Science Interview Instagram</a> &amp; <a href="http://eepurl.com/gaSjD5">Nick&#x27;s tech careers email newsletter</a> to get more like this.
