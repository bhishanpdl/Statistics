# Qn1
 If there is a 30 percent probability that you will see a supercar in any 20-minute time interval, what is the proba­bility that you see at least one supercar in the period of an hour (60 minutes)?

```
The probability of not seeing a supercar in 20 minutes is:
= 1 − P(Seeing one supercar)
= 1 − 0.3
= 0.7
Probability of not seeing any supercar in the period of 60 minutes is:
= (0.7) ^ 3 = 0.343
Hence, the probability of seeing at least one supercar in 60 minutes is:
= 1 − P(Not seeing any supercar)
= 1 − 0.343 = 0.657
