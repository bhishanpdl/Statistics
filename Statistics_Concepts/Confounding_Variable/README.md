# Confounding Variable
- https://www.scribbr.com/methodology/confounding-variables/

A confounding variable, or a confounder, is a variable that influences both the dependent variable and the independent variable, causing a spurious association, a mathematical relationship in which two or more variables are associated but not causally related.


In research that investigates a potential cause-and-effect relationship, a confounding variable is an unmeasured third variable that influences both the supposed cause and the supposed effect.

**What is a confounding variable?**  


Confounding variables, which are also called confounders or confounding factors, are closely related to a studyâ€™s independent and dependent variables. A variable must meet two conditions to be a confounder:

It must be correlated with the independent variable. This may be a causal relationship, but it does not have to be.
It must be causally related to the dependent variable.


1. Example: ice-cream vs sunburn (temperature)
You collect data on sunburns and ice cream consumption. You find that higher ice cream consumption is associated with a higher probability of sunburn. Does that mean ice cream consumption causes sunburn?
Here, the confounding variable is temperature: hot temperatures cause people to both eat more ice cream and spend more time outdoors under the sun, resulting in more sunburns.

2. Example: smoking mother vs higher weight baby (unhealthy food)
You find that babies born to mothers who smoked during their pregnancies weigh significantly less than those born to non-smoking mothers. However, if you do not account for the fact that smokers are more likely to engage in other unhealthy behaviors, such as drinking or eating less healthy foods, then you might overestimate the relationship between smoking and low birth weight.
