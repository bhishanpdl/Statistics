# Meaning
In statistics, the coefficient of determination, denoted $R^2$
and pronounced "R squared", is the proportion of the variance in
the dependent variable that is predictable from the independent variable(s).

Suppose R2 = 0.49. This implies that 49% of the variability of the dependent variable has been accounted for, and the remaining 51% of the variability is still unaccounted for. 

# Formula
$$
R^2 = 1 - \frac{SS_{res}}{SS_{tot}}
$$
$$
SS_{reg} = \Sigma_i e_i^2
$$
$$
SS_{tot} = \Sigma_i (y_i - \tilde{y})^2
$$
